# Introduction

This is the open source textbook and end-user manual for theorem proving with Existential Graphs in PMH. We will refer to
the Existential Graph System as the EG System and Existential Graphs themselves as EGs from now on.

If you don't know any formal logic whatsoever, don't worry! This book will explain the basics and how they relate to EGs.
